# Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Blank Page When Clicking Projects (FIXED)

### Problem:
- Clicking on a project in "My Projects" redirected to `/client/projects/:projectId`
- This route doesn't exist, causing blank page

### Solution:
- Removed the `onClick` navigation from the project card div
- Users now click specific buttons (View Applications, Edit Project, Leave Review)
- No more blank page redirects

---

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Reviews Not Visible in Profiles (FIXED)

### Problem:
- Reviews weren't loading because `user` object wasn't ready when `fetchReviews()` was called
- `useEffect` with `fetchReviews()` ran before `user` was available

### Solution:

**ClientProfile.jsx:**
```javascript
// Split into two useEffects
useEffect(() => {
  load(); // Load profile
}, [token]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (user?._id) {
    fetchReviews(); // Fetch reviews only when user is available
  }
}, [user]);
```

**StudentProfile.jsx:**
```javascript
// Same pattern
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProfile();
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  if (user?._id) {
    fetchReviews();
  }
}, [user]);
```

## üîç Debug Tips:

If reviews still don't show:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any errors in console
3. Check Network tab ‚Üí Look for `/api/reviews/user/:userId` request
4. Check if response has reviews data
5. Verify user is logged in (check `user` object in console)

If blank page appears:
1. Check browser URL when it happens
2. Verify route exists in `main.jsx`
3. Check console for routing errors
